== L#SDAJ ~And you too, dear Osprey. Look at how you've grown in just a few months. I never thought we'd see each other again so soon, but I'm glad we did.~
== C0CR2OSJ ~I wouldn't have thought it either! I was even more surprised when I read your letter telling me that the church of Oghma had officially accepted you. Should I also call you Sir Arkanis now?~
== L#SDAJ ~Heh. Sir or not, it's all the same to me when it comes to you. There's no hierarchy between old friends.~
== C0CR2OSJ ~Hehe...~
== L#SDAJ ~So, how has life in Erlkazar been treating you? I imagine the Spirit Soaring isn't so different from Candlekeep, just with more freedom now, eh?~
== C0CR2OSJ ~Oh, it's been wonderful. Trying to get used to a new life hasn't been the easiest, but with master Cadderly's help, I've settled in. And made quite a few new friends too.~
== L#SDAJ ~That's good. But it seems you haven't forgotten your old friends either, have you? I heard you ran right back here as soon as the news of the crusade hit.~
== C0CR2OSJ ~I did. For about the same reasons as you, I imagine. We can't leave <CHARNAME> when <PRO_HESHE> needs us, even if we're no longer in Candlekeep, right?~
== L#SDAJ ~Exactly right. Show me what you've learned in the time you've spent out here, Osprey!~
== C0CR2OSJ ~And I'll be expecting the same from you, Arkanis!~
