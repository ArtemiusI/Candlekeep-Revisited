SAY DESC ~Ring of Insight
Though seemingly just an unremarkable silver band, this ring has a slight magical enchantment which expands the wearer's capacity for storing old knowledge, making it useful for aiding in the memory of the aging scribes and lorekeepers of Candlekeep who wist through hundreds of pages each day. Though its usefulness in combat is nonexistent, it can aid in the identification of rare and magical objects.
