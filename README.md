This mod adds more content to the oft-considered tiresome prologue of the first Baldur’s Gate, adding ‘new’ NPCs, extended dialogue with Gorion and your childhood acquaintances, the option to allow Imoen to join you in your last wandering around Candlekeep, as well as many, many extra scenes, including a starting sequence based on your main character’s class with various starting bonuses.

In essence, this turns the tutorial into a boring section of the game which most people choose to either skip or quickly rush through for some starting experience to a more prolonged experience with moments of friendship, some development of Gorion’s character (interpretations may vary) and overall a more emotional departure that makes the homecoming sweeter. The mod also adds some minor Chapter 6 content which builds off the new connections, though most of the focus is in the prologue.

New content:

– Introduction of the ‘tutorial party members’—Arkanis, Canderous, Deder, Mordaine and Osprey—as new NPCs in Candlekeep’s courtyard, with dialogues and personalities

– Three minor sidequests involving the NPCs

– An experience reward with words of wisdom from Tethtoril if you complete every optional sidequest in Candlekeep, giving you enough experience to level up. (If you don't want it, tell him you don't have the time to listen.)

– Extra dialogue with the NPCs for your reunion with them in Chapter 6

– Improved Arkanis and Deder in the catacomb sequence in Chapter 6, making them stronger, controllable, and expanding their dialogue

– An optional component for an extended starting sequence based on class, paired with extended dialogue with Gorion and an earlier appearance of Ulraunt

– New optional portraits for the aforementioned five NPCs in place of their vanilla portraits
